### Syntax and Doc Rules ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è

These rules are required to render the course on hf.co/learn üòä 
1. Every chapter should have a main header (h1, e.g. # Introduction) before the content. 
2. We can use the syntax features in Hugging Face course! This includes üëá 

**Tip Blocks**
Write tips like so:
```
<Tip>
Write your note here
</Tip>
```
You can write warnings like this: 
`<Tip warning={true}>`

**Framework Dependent Code**
To have multiple frameworks in one code snippet with a toggle, you can do:
```
<frameworkcontent>
<pt>
PyTorch content goes here
</pt>
<tf>
TensorFlow content goes here
</tf>
<flax>
Flax content goes here
</flax>
</frameworkcontent>
```

**Anchor Links for Headers**
If you want to refer to a section inside the text, you can do it like below üëá 
```
## My awesome section[[some-section]]
// the anchor link is: `some-section`
```

**Code Blocks**
You can write codeblocks by wrapping it with three backticks. Please add the associated language code, e.g. `py` or `bash` after top backticks to enable language specific rendering of code blocks. 

**LaTeX**
You can write LaTeX by writing it like this: `$$...$$``
For example üëá 
```
$$Y = X * \textbf{dequantize}(W); \text{quantize}(W)$$
```

3. Add your chapter to `_toctree.yml`.

- Note that the directory structure is as follows, so when you add a new chapter, make sure to stick to it:
```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ course/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chapters/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chapter0/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ introduction.mdx
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ getting_started.mdx
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chapter1/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...mdx
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _toctree.yml
```

- Before contributing, please read the general [contribution guide](https://huggingface2.notion.site/Contribution-Guide-19411c29298644df8e9656af45a7686d?pvs=4).

- If you have any images, videos and more in your PRs, please store them in [this Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hf-vision/course-assets) to keep this repository lightweight. You can ask for an access to the organization if you aren't a part of it yet.

### Become a Reviewer

Is everything already assigned, but you still really want to contribute to the course? No worries, you can still become a reviewer! This will allow you to review the notebooks and READMEs and give feedback to the authors.

1. Go [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fjmbsdGwe7IUMBv74LDC7IpoJy8ijiFdzGdnDlBv6eA/edit#gid=0) and at the bottom choose the "Reviewers" tab,
2. Add your first name and GitHub username,
3. You'll be added to the repo as a contributor and will be able to review Pull Requests (PRs)!
4. Assign yourself to any PRs you think make sense for you,
5. While reviewing, ask yourself if the changes and additions make sense - After all, the most important part of a course is conveying ideas properly, which makes the learning experience smoother.
6. Share your feedback and ideas with the authors on how they can improve. In the long term, we're aiming to make a robust, high-quality course accessible to everyone!
7. Finally, every PR can be merged when it has two approvals from reviewers.


### Tips and Hints


- For an easier collaboration when **working on notebooks together**, feel free to use [ReviewNB](https://www.reviewnb.com/), which is free for open-source and educational use cases.

- In the requirements.txt file you can find some packages that can be helpful when creating the material. As we're originating from the HuggingFace community, we can recommend using the  [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/), [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/), [evaluate](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/) and [timm](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/) libraries.
